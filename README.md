# insideMeasurements
This is working code for the hardware built in "A Study on the Effectiveness of Passive Solar Buildings in Ladakh, India" by A. R. Nordstrom and L. N. N. Bjorkman. We have NOT done anything to any file except the one in "measurement-kit_final", and a large part of the code there is based on examples from the libraries. The libraries themselfes are in the repository since we have made small changes to the BMP-library and we do not want future changes in the libraries to create bugs in the project code.
